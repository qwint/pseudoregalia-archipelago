# APMenuMod

The assets in this folder are adapted with permission from
[PseudoMenuMod](https://github.com/pseudoregalia-modding/pseudo-menu). This mod provides a file select menu meant to
manage Archipelago saves and connect with Archipelago servers. The assets in the PseudoMenuMod folder in this repo are
unchanged from that project but are included because the APMenuMod assets depend on them.

The AP mod patches the main menu asset to open the AP file select menu when the "File Select" button is
pressed. This makes it incompatible with PseudoMenuMod, which also patches the main menu asset.
