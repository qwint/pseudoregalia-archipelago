Want to install Pseudoregalia Archipelago Mod on Steam Deck? 

1. In Game Mode, ensure you have opened the base game at least once. Close it, then go to Desktop Mode.
2. In Steam/steamapps/common, make a copy of your Pseudoregalia folder and rename it "Pseudoregalia_AP" (or whatever else you like).
   * If you would like to play on full gold version, downpatch using the beta code `fullgoldjump` in Steam before copying the folder. You can make an AP folder for both versions if you want to be able to play on both.
3. Extract the contents of pseudoregalia-archipelago.zip directly into "Pseudoregalia_AP". You should notice no change to the root folder, but the mod files will be added to the subfolders.
4. Open the Steam Client, Add a Non-Steam Game, then go to Pseudoregalia_AP folder and select pseudoregalia.exe
5. Open Properties, then ensure that you check compatibility to Force Proton Experimental.
   * If Experimental doesn't work, try a different version (8.0-5 was verified to work)
6. Lastly, Pseudoregalia utilizes Visual C++ Runtime 2022. Download Protontricks if you have not already. This is located within Discovery. After launching Protontricks, select Non-Steam Shortcut: pseudoregalia.exe. Select the default wineprefix, install a Windows DLL or component, then scroll down and select vcrun2022. Wait and follow the prompts the prompts until it has installed twice. You can go through this process twice if you are unsure, when you scroll down to vcrun2022 again, it should already be checked. It has installed correctly.
7. Launch in Game Mode which should open Pseudoregalia. Start a new file.
8. Once you've loaded into the game, You will need to edit your controls to include `enter` and show keyboard for this. I recommend L4 and R4, respectively. Press your button for `enter` to open the in-game console, and enter your connect message:
`/connect ip:port slotname password`
